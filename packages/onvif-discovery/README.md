This is still in the early stages of development, structure of outputs and underlying code is still in flux, feel free to use and provide feedback but do not expect a stable API/behavior untill after version 1.0.0

## Purpose of node

This node can either on a timed interval or triggered input, run a web service discovery request to find onvif cameras on your network.
